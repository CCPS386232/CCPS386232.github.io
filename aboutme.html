      <h1> About Me</h1>
      <p> In my personal life i am working towards being a supporter in my community, as for my professional life i am working towards being either in the NBA or NFL. I am working towards these goals by finding different ways to make money, and i am working towards my professional goal by trying to get better at basketball and football when ever i have the time to. The values i consider most necessary are, determination, effort, time, and hard work. Some short term goals i hope to accomplish in the near future are being able to give back to at least one person and to make varsity for either football or basketball. Some character traits and achievements i most want to be known for is a determined, hard working, kind, humble person. And for achievements id like to be known for is someone whos helped lead the basketball team or football team to a state championship.</p>
